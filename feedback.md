Good work! ðŸ¥³ You managed to implement the functionality you agreed with the UX team. 
The code is well-structured and easy to read. It's clear that you have a good understanding of react, react-router-dom, use of ternaries, and css. 

Improvements:

- Add a readme file with the description of the project. I understand the time constraints, but it's important to have a readme file in a real-world project. Even if you are not working on it anymore, I suggest you add it.
Let people know that this project was collaboratively developed by you and the UX team. Tell us about the story behind the project (improving a real app), the technologies used, who worked on it, and how to run it.

- Delete unused files. 

- Add a favicon to the project. The one you have is the default one.

- Switch to svg instead of png for the images that are not photos, like the purses. This is going to make the images look better on different screen sizes with no loss of quality and maybe even reduce the size of the images.

- Time management: Each afternoon was supposed to be divided in time for the project / time for the labs. This  forces us to switch between back and front end. This way we would have a more realistic experience of a fullstack developer and having multiple projects at the same time. 
Try to negotiate with the team to reduce the amount of work. Delivering a project with less functionality was not a problem in this case. 
Negotiation is a key skill in a developer's life.
